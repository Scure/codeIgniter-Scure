			It's been awhile since we've updated our blog but we're working hard on mobile and web development at the moment.  
			A lot of the team has been working late into the night to achieve this.  One of us is working full-time, the other is at school full-time, 
			and the other is going through a round of interviews and interning at the moment.  Our goal is to have a working web/mobile prototype by the 
			mid/end of December.  

			As for the hardware......
			<br><br>
			Our little device is now up-and-running its own mini-server.  We're able to communicate with it via our web application.  Of course all of the
			communication is still extremely basic.  While we're waiting on more parts for our hardware prototype, we're focusing our efforts full-steam to
			finish as much of the web/mobile application as possible.

			<h3>Phase 1: Parts and Web Programming</h3> 
			<code>9/10/13</code>
			<p style="width:750px; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; color:gray; font-size:16px; line-height:21px;">
			The parts finally arrived this past weekend and we are extremely excited to start putting everything together.  We are working 
			long nights to develop our web application, as well as put together the hardware prototype.  There's something about new parts arriving
			in the mail that radiates excitement. Most likely...because.....we're temporarily free from the waves of debugging and faulty parts that
			that are sure to ensue.   But for now, we're extremely excited to be working on our first non-university hardware/software project!  Stay tuned!

			<h3>Inception and Prototyping</h3> 
			<code>8/28/13</code>
			<p style="width:750px; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; color:gray; font-size:16px; line-height:21px;">
			Prototyping stage is underway! Once the ordered parts come in, we will start setting up the basic communication protocols between our 
			main microcontroller unit and our web server.  First task we want to accomplish is setting up a secure/authentication protocol to sync up 
			the main hub device to the web server.
